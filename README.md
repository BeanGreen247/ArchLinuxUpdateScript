# ArchLinuxUpdateScript
Yet another Arch Linux update script.

Designed to be user friendly. After launch it will clear the credentials, once it gets the password it will begin the update process. If no password is typed in it will display an error message. Color coded and created for bash.

All parts are commented so it should all be explained.
